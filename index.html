    <h1>The Destroyer Of Worlds</h1>
    <p><b> J. Robert Oppenheimer </b> (born Julius Robert Oppenheimer; /ˈɒpənhaɪmər/ OP-ən-hy-mər; April 22, 1904 – February 18, 1967) was an American theoretical physicist. He was director of the Manhattan Project's Los Alamos Laboratory during World War II and is often called the "father of the atomic bomb".

        Born in New York City, Oppenheimer earned a bachelor of arts degree in chemistry from Harvard University in 1925 and a doctorate in physics from the University of Göttingen in Germany in 1927, where he studied under Max Born. After research at other institutions, he joined the physics department at the University of California, Berkeley, where he became a full professor in 1936. He made significant contributions to theoretical physics, including achievements in quantum mechanics and nuclear physics such as the Born–Oppenheimer approximation for molecular wave functions, work on the theory of electrons and positrons, the Oppenheimer–Phillips process in nuclear fusion, and early work on quantum tunneling. With his students, he also made contributions to the theory of neutron stars and black holes, quantum field theory, and the interactions of cosmic rays.</p>

    <h3>Biographies</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Oppenheimer's birth certificate reads "Julius Robert Oppenheimer",[1][2] his college transcript "J Robert Oppenheimer".[3] Oppenheimer himself said the J stood for nothing, and his brother Frank "surmised that the J was symbolic, a gesture in the direction of naming the eldest son after the father but at the same time a signal that his parents did not want Robert to be a 'junior.'"</li>
        <li>Due to the subsequent development of the Standard Model, the muon is now considered to be a lepton and not a meson</li>
        <li>He also spoke Dutch, German, French and some Chinese.</li>
        <li> Oppenheimer already had three PhD students who had commenced under another supervisor: Harvey Hall and J. Franklin Carlson under William Howell Williams; and Leo Nedelsky, who had started under Samuel K. Allison. In 1931, Hall became the first of Oppenheimer's students to complete his PhD.</li>
